# HW1
    This part mainly concerns about KNN, decision tree and the effect of data standardlization.
    In addition, we can also find the problem of overfitting and have a intuitional view of how overfitting can
    influence the behavior of the model, and how to search around combinations of hyperparameters to somehow 
    overcome the problem of overfitting.
